# ITA-Developer Keyboard Layout
A Keyboard layout made to let you feel at home.

The layout I made is a standard Windows Italian Layout but it has *nix like functionality for the backtick and tilde characters.

If you are coming from macOS you're used to Alt+\ for the backtick and Alt+5 for the tilde.

I ported those shortcuts using ```Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4```.

To install this keyboard layout, get the latest release from the [releases](/releases) page of this GitHub repo.

### Shortcuts

- ` -> ```AltGr```+```\```
- ~ -> ```AltGr```+```5```
